# Pitch Perfect Writeup

## What I learned:
- Stack Views
- Autolayout
- Introduction to Segues

This was the first iOS app required as part of the Udacity iOS Nanodegree. Overall, it is meant to familiarize students with Xcode, Storyboards, Outlets, and Actions. This is the third of fourth iOS project/learning assignment I've done overall, and I found it to be the most focused on Storyboards.

## What I plan to do next:
I plan on simplifying the recording screen by getting rid of the stop button. Instead the record button will change into a stop button once pressed. Additionally, I plan on allowing the record button to be held to record. Through implementing this feature, I will learn more about UIGestureRecognizer.
